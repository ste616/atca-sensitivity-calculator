    <title>ATCA Sensitivity Calculator - Help</title>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="weighting">
      <h2>Help: Image Weighting</h2>
      The sensitivity calculator uses Robust weighting only when computing the image
      weighting factors, since Robust weighting is preferable over Natural and Uniform
      schemes. When using Robust weighting, Robust=2 is essentially Natural weighting,
      and Robust=-2 is essentially Uniform. The weighting factor shown in the image
      parameters table describes exactly how the image RMS noise would compare to a
      traditionally Natural-weighted image. These factors have been determined using
      simulations over a range of frequencies and hour-angle ranges.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="weatherConditions">
      <h2>Help: Weather Conditions</h2>
      The weather conditions used by the sensitivity calculator are derived from a
      study into the variations in ground temperature, pressure and humidity observed at
      the ATCA site over the past five years. The atmospheric opacity and temperature were derived
      from these parameters, and were used to select the best, worst and typical
      conditions used by the calculator for each season that can be selected. You
      should expect that although you can have the "best" weather conditions for a
      short time during your observations, you will probably never reach the sensitivity
      shown in the "best" case. You should also always do better than the "worst"
      case. The sensitivity shown for "typical" weather conditions should be very
      close to what you would get for a normal observation in the selected season.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="rmsNoise">
      <h2>Help: RMS noise level</h2>
      The RMS noise level computed by the sensitivity calculator is:
      <div>$S_{\rm rms} = \cfrac{\sqrt{2} k {\rm T}_{\rm S} W}{10^{-26} A_{\rm ant} \epsilon \sqrt{N_{\rm ant}(N_{\rm ant} - 1) \Delta\nu \tau}}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>$S_{\rm rms}$ is the RMS noise level, in units of mJy/beam,</li>
	<li>$k$ is the Boltzmann constant, in units of ${\rm J}.{\rm K}^{-1}$,</li>
	<li>${\rm T}_{\rm S}$ is the system temperature, in units of K,</li>
	<li>$W$ is the image weighting factor (where for Natural weighting $W=1$),</li>
	<li>$A_{\rm ant}$ is the surface area of a single antenna, in units of ${\rm m}^{2}$,</li>
	<li>$\epsilon$ is the efficiency of the antenna (where for a perfect antenna $\epsilon=1$),</li>
	<li>$N_{\rm ant}$ is the number of antenna in the array,</li>
	<li>$\Delta\nu$ is the bandwidth, in units of MHz,</li>
	<li>$\tau$ is the integration time, in units of seconds.</li>
      </ul>
      <br />
      This provides the flux density of an unpolarised point source at the phase
      centre that is equal to the RMS noise level.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="brightnessTemperature">
      <h2>Help: Brightness Sensitivity</h2>
      The brightness sensitivity computed by the calculator is:
      <div>$\sigma_{\rm BT} = \cfrac{10^{-26}S_{\rm rms}\lambda^{2}}{2k} \cfrac{(180/\pi)^{2}}{\pi \theta_{\rm min} \theta_{\rm maj}}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>$\sigma_{\rm BT}$ is the brightness sensitivity, in units of K,</li>
	<li>$S_{\rm rms}$ is the RMS noise level, in units of Jy/beam,</li>
	<li>$\lambda$ is the wavelength, in units of m,</li>
	<li>$k$ is the Boltzmann constant, in units of ${\rm J}.{\rm K}^{-1}$,</li>
	<li>$\theta_{\rm min}$ is the semi-minor axis length of the synthesised beam, in units of degrees,</li>
	<li>$\theta_{\rm maj}$ is the semi-major axis length of the synthesised beam, in units of degrees.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="systemTemperature">
      <h2>Help: System Temperature</h2>
      The system temperature reported by the calculator has contributions from the
      receiver temperature, atmospheric temperature and CMB temperature, and is scaled by the inverse
      of the antenna efficiency.<br />
      The atmospheric and CMB temperatures both depend on the elevation of the
      antenna and the atmospheric zenith opacity:
      <div>$f({\rm el}) = e^{-\tau_{z} / \sin({\rm el})}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>el is the elevation of the antenna,</li>
	<li>$\tau_{z}$ is the atmospheric opacity at zenith (or el = 90$^\circ$).</li>
      </ul><br />
      The CMB temperature contribution is computed by $T_{\rm CMB} = 2.7\times f({\rm el})$.<br />
      The atmospheric temperature contribution is computed by
      $T_{\rm atm} = T_{a}(\nu)(1 - f({\rm el}))$, where $T_{a}(\nu)$ is the brightness of radiation from
      the atmosphere (which is strongly frequency dependant).<br />
      The atmospheric radiation brightness and opacity are calculated using the model of Liebe (1985),
      which is dependant on frequency, and the ground-level temperature, pressure and humidity.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="antennaSEFD">
      <h2>Help: Antenna and Array Sensitivity</h2>
      The antenna and array sensitivities are actually Source Equivalent
      Flux Densities (SEFD), which are computed by the calculator in the following way:
      <div>${\rm SEFD} = \cfrac{2k{\rm T}_{\rm meas}}{10^{-26}A}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>$k$ is the Boltzmann constant, in units of ${\rm J}.{\rm K}^{-1}$,</li>
	<li>${\rm T}_{\rm meas}$ is the system temperature, accounting for the antenna efficiency and
	  atmospheric temperature, in units of K,</li>
	<li>$A$ is the surface area of the antenna (or array of antennas), in units of m$^{2}$.</li>
      </ul><br />
      The SEFD corresponds to the intensity of a source required to increase the noise in
      the antenna (or array) by the equivalent of the system temperature.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="velocityWidths">
      <h2>Help: Velocity Width and Resolution</h2>
      The range of velocity covered by an entire band is referred to by the calculator
      as the velocity width, while the range of velocity covered by a single channel of
      that band is referred to as the velocity resolution. Both values are computed in
      exactly the same way:
      <div>$\Delta v = \cfrac{c \nu_{0} \Delta\nu}{\nu_{l}(\nu_{l} + \Delta\nu)}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>$\Delta v$ is the range of velocity, in units of km/s,</li>
	<li>$c$ is the speed of light, in units of km/s,</li>
	<li>$\nu_{0}$ is the rest frequency of the radiation, in units of MHz,</li>
	<li>$\Delta\nu$ is the bandwidth or resolution used, in units of MHz,</li>
	<li>$\nu_{l}$ is the lowest frequency observed in the band or channel, in units of MHz.</li>
      </ul><br />
      For bands where the exact frequency range is known and doesn't vary (for
      example the continuum band or the specific zoom band), this equation is used as is. In
      all other cases (for example, each individual continuum channel, or a general zoom band
      somewhere in the continuum band), the velocity range is calculated by taking the
      exact velocity range of a larger band and multiplying by the fractional bandwidth
      represented by the smaller band. Such velocity ranges will be close enough for most
      purposes.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="primaryBeam">
      <h2>Help: Primary Beam FWHM</h2>
      The primary beam full-width at half-maximum is calculated as follows:
      <div>$\theta_{\rm PB}(\nu) = \cfrac{c\nu}{D_{\rm ant}}$,</div>
      where<br />
      <ul>
	<li>$\theta_{\rm PB}(\nu)$ is the primary beam FWHM at frequency $\nu$,</li>
	<li>$c$ is the speed of light,</li>
	<li>$D_{\rm ant}$ is the diameter of the antenna.</li>
      </ul><br />
      The calculator always computes the primary beam FWHM using the frequency at
      the centre of the band of interest. For low frequencies and wide bandwidths, the
      primary beam size will vary significantly over the band.
    </div>

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="synthesisedBeam">
      <h2>Help: Synthesised Beam FWHM</h2>
      The synthesised beam full-width at half-maximum is calculated using the maximum
      $u$ and $v$ projected baseline lengths that the array makes while observing between
      hour angles $H_{\rm start}$ and $H_{\rm end}$.<br />
      The natural baseline lengths are described in the Cartesian coordinate system (as
      described in the <a href="http://www.narrabri.atnf.csiro.au/observing/users_guide/html/atug.html#Observatory-Coordinates">
	ATCA Users Guide</a>. The baseline lengths in $X$, $Y$ and $Z$ should be expressed
      in wavelengths by dividing by the wavelength at the centre of the band, making
      $X_{\lambda}$, $Y_{\lambda}$ and $Z_{\lambda}$.<br />
      The hour angle that corresponds to maximum $u$ for a particular baseline can be
      calculated with:
      <div>$H(u_{\rm max}) = \arctan\left(\cfrac{X_{\lambda}}{Y_{\lambda}}\right)$,</div>
      and for maximum $v$:
      <div>$H(v_{\rm max}) = \arctan\left(\cfrac{-Y_{\lambda}}{X_{\lambda}}\right)$.</div>
      We then choose the closest hour angle to these that was actually observed (or exactly
      these hour angles if possible) to determine $u_{\rm max}$ and $v_{\rm max}$:
      <div>$u_{\rm max} = | X_{\lambda}\sin(H(u_{\rm max})) + Y_{\lambda}\cos(H(u_{\rm max})) |$,</div>
      and
      <div>$v_{\rm max} = |-X_{\lambda}\sin(\delta)\cos(H(v_{\rm max})) + Y_{\lambda}\sin(\delta)\sin(H(v_{\rm max})) + Z_{\lambda}\cos(\delta)|$,</div>
      where $\delta$ is the declination of the source being observed.<br />
      The synthesised beam size in the $l$ and $m$ directions are just the inverse of
      $u_{\rm max}$ and $v_{\rm max}$ respectively, although they also depend on the
      weighting scheme used for imaging, so that $w_{\rm beam} = 1$ for Natural weighting,
      and smaller than that as the weighting tends to Uniform:
      <div>$l_{res} = \cfrac{w_{\rm beam}}{u_{\rm max}}$,</div>
      and
      <div>$m_{res} = \cfrac{w_{\rm beam}}{v_{\rm max}}$.</div>
      One of $l_{res}$ and $m_{res}$ will usually be smaller than the other, and that
      is identified as the minor axis resolution $\theta_{\rm min}$, while the other
      is the major axis resolution $\theta_{\rm maj}$.

    <div class="helpSection invisible" id="changeLog">
      <h2>Change Log</h2>
      <h3>2015-April-22</h3>
      Complete recode of the sensitivity calculator in Python, to clear out all the
      assumptions made by the old calculator. The old calculator was producing
      overly pessimistic results, as verified by B. Emonts and M. Mao. This new
      calculator improves on the old one in several ways, including taking better
      account of weather conditions observed at the ATCA during the CABB era.
